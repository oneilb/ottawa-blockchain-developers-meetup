# Meetup #2: Documenting the requirements and writing specifications for the first OTTCoin release

In this meetup we will review the ideas that have been added to [Issues](https://github.com/marleymarl/ottawa-blockchain-developers-meetup/issues) using one of the following labels: 

- Desired Behavior
- Undedesired Behavior
- Incentive
- Penalty

After reviewing those and any others added during the meetup as part of the conversation, we will make decisions using a voting token created only for the purposes of this meetup. 

Here is a video on how to use [Github Issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YshvUGgF_3o)

**Anyone who adds an idea prior to the meetup that ends up getting used will receive an additional 0.5x multiplier in the Meetup #2 OTTCoin distribution for each idea provided and used.**

After we make decisions on the initial desired behaviors and incentives, and undesired behaviors and penalties and document them as requirements. We will then write the specifications on how we intend to accomplish that with smart contract code and how we can write tests for those. If we have time, we will write javascript tests using Truffle Suite (Mocha and Chai) and/or set-up the work to be done in between Meetup #2 and Meetup #3.
