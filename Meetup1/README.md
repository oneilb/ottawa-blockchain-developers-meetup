# Meetup #1: Ethereum Solidity vs Hyperledger Chaincode - a live coding session

Enterprises are actively evaluating whether to use Ethereum or Hyperledger or a combination thereof for some key use cases. In this meetup [Greg Marlin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-marlin-8a4528a/) will live code smart contracts in Ethereum Solidity and Hyperledger Chaincode for a key use case (trading derivatives) and we can discuss the pros and cons of each.

## Requirements


1. [Git](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03)
2. [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. Docker: [Windows Install](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) / [Mac Install](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)



## Use Case Instructions

The use case we will be using as a basis for the smart contracts is that of trading derivatives - specifically [Credit Default Swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp), as seen in [The Big Short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-7HA9_qmdg)

For more information on derivatives, see [The History of Derivatives Trading](https://medium.com/market-protocol/the-history-of-derivatives-trading-631e9ab64fed).

## Recap of Meeting

In our Meetup #1 Greg Marlin presented his vision for what it would take to make Ottawa the #1 or #2 top city in the world for expertise in decentralized governance. We also discussed the plan for the next meetup in preparing for coding an OTTCoin that would be used for voting on the subjects of future meetups and for other projects. 

We briefly discussed token economics for the OTTCoin and how they could be used to incent the behaviors we want, such as showing up on time for the meetup, and disincentivize or discourage the behaviors we don't want, such as showing up late or RSVP'ing and not showing up. 

Greg provided a list for attendees to provide their name, email address and physical addresses so that a distribution of OTTCoins could be made for those that attended, when the OTTCoin smart contract eventually gets written. 

**Similar multipliers will be in effect for the distribution related to attendance and participation in Meetup #2. **

We also discussed using the meetup Github and Greg to provide some training for people on how to use it to collaborate effectively on this. We decided as a group that it would be most efficient to try and get a lot of the prep and discussion work done prior to a meetup so that we could make effective decisions and get down to writing code and updating the repos accordingly. 

We decided that we should collaborate on adding ideas for behaviors to incentivize and discourage and mechanisms for doing that to the repo. After some consideration, Greg decided that the best way to do that is through *labeled issues*. 

Here is a link to a video that trains you on [how to use github issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YshvUGgF_3o). 

For Meetup #2, we will be discussing the specifications for the token economics with relation to incentivizing the behaviors we want and discouraging the behaviors we don't. Greg has created the following labels for use in adding ideas as issues: 

- Desired Behavior
- Incentive


We also had a look at some live Solidity smart contract code using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org) and compared that to [Hyperledger Fabric Chaincode](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode.html) using Node JS.
